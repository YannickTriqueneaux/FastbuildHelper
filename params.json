{"name":"FASTBuild Helper","tagline":"","body":"**FASTBuild Helper is an open-source template solution to facilite the integration of [FASTBuild](http://www.fastbuild.org/docs/home.html) on an existing or a new C++ project**\r\n\r\n### The idea\r\nPersonally a realy like FASTBuild, this build tool do a very powerfull job without any dependencies et complicated installation. But the problem is: if you want to use it, you must be an exeperimented programmer specialy in compilation things and the final syntaxs are unreadable for a none fastbuild integrator.\r\nWhen I started to integrate FASTBuild in my last company I was a beginner in compilations things and the challenge was to port thereadbouts 375 C++ projects (like VisualStudio projects), so the challenge was realy tough.\r\n\r\nIn order to succeed I chose to achieve the following goals:\r\n1. Be able to generate all .bff files. (375 projects to support)\r\n2. Provide a generic and readable interface for a none fastbuild integrator.\r\n3. Do not expose compilers things for those who don't understand them.\r\n4. Provide a multiplateform interface.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYannick Triqueneaux\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nYannick$triqueneaux@gmail.com.
