{"name":"FASTBuild Helper","tagline":"","body":"**FASTBuild Helper is an open-source template solution to facilite the integration of [FASTBuild](http://www.fastbuild.org/docs/home.html) on an existing or a new C++ project**\r\n\r\n### **The idea**\r\nPersonally a really like FASTBuild, this build tool do a very powerful job without any dependencies et complicated installations. But the problem is: if you want to use it, you must be an exeperimented programmer specially in compilation things and the final syntax is unreadable for a non-fastbuild-integrator.\r\nWhen I started to integrate FASTBuild in my last company I was a beginner with compilations things and the challenge was to port approximately 375 C++ projects (like VisualStudio projects), so the challenge was really tough.\r\n\r\nIn order to succeed I imaginated an only one interface achieving the following goals:\r\n\r\n1. Must be readable and editable for a non-fastbuild-integrator.\r\n2. Should not expose any compilers things for those who don't understand them.\r\n3. Provide a multi-plateform interface.\r\n4. **Should not create another language,** the interface must uniquely be in FASTBuild's language. \r\n5. Should provide a format which can be generated easily.\r\n\r\n### **How to use it**\r\n\r\nThe first, start by reading about the FASTBuild's language. The interface is readable without it but you may be handicapped and quickly do some mistakes. (see: [FASTBuild language](http://www.fastbuild.org/docs/syntaxguide.html))\r\n\r\nYou have to know that this helper is not perfectly generic for all needs, this one provide a generic interface but in order to support you owns you will have to customize it according to your personnal requirements. In example: this one works with **VisualStudio 2015 in Windows** and **GCC in Linux**, also it will compile all *.cpp files inside your projects directories. But it's prettry easy change those things.\r\n\r\nI advise you to start with a little \"hello world\" test. The helper provides a easy interface but not enough to stay in few lignes. Also you can rely on these [Examples]().\r\n\r\nFinally, in order to understand this \"FASTBuild Helper\", I suggest you to read these slides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n**Yannick Triqueneaux**\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nyannick__triqueneaux@gmail.com.
